# openapi-casegen
openapi-casegen is a developer tool that automatically generates test case definitions from your OpenAPI specification. Its goal is to ensure that every documented endpoint, parameter, and request field in your API has a corresponding test — eliminating the “did I test this input?” uncertainty in backend development.
